                  Multidisciplinary artist Judy Chicago helped pioneer the
                  feminist art movement in the 1960s and ’70s; for decades, she
                  has made work that celebrates the multiplicity of female
                  identity. Chicago’s practice spans painting, textile arts,
                  sculpture, and installation and has explored the intricacies
                  of childbirth (as seen in her “Birth Project” series,
                  1980–85), the possibilities of minimalist sculpture, and the
                  relationship between landscape and the female body. Her most
                  famous work, an installation called The Dinner Party
                  (1974–79), is an homage to 39 influential female figures from
                  Eastern and Western mythology and civilization. Chicago
                  studied at the University of California, Los Angeles. She
                  founded a groundbreaking and widely influential feminist art
                  program while on staff at California State University, Fresno.
                  Her work has been exhibited in New York, London, Milan,
                  Chicago, and San Francisco and belongs in the collections of
                  the British Museum, Moderna Museet, the Metropolitan Museum of
                  Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Tate, the Art
                  Institute of Chicago, and the National Gallery of Art in
